Network Essentials :
 LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) :
  1. IP (Internet Protocol) : Specific address given to a computer or a device like the roll number of a student.
  2. SUBNET : It defines the range of the LAN which looks like 255.255.0.0 where these 255 tells the constant value and the 0's are the changable values
  3. ROUTER : Allows the device fromt the LAN to communicate to the Outside Networks
 WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK) :
  1. NAT (NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSMISSION) : It hides the local area IP and change it into some other IP's like 192.168.1.10 to 6.23.5.3
  2. FIREWALL : Restricts the communication of the Internet or the outside Network into the local Area Network which is like blocking the access
  3. DMZ (DE MILITARIZED ZONE) : LAN create a DMZ where the external device comes for the communication will be moved to the DMZ for communication where the device will be responsible for everything
  4. PORT FORWARDING : It also uses for the communication of external device directly into the network by selecting a port forwarding where communcation happens in the forwarded port only.
  

CIA Triad :
 1. Confendiatility : Secure for the user
 2. Integrity : no data modification is done without permission	
 3. Availability : data is available for the legal users

How Internet works :
 1. DNS = translates names to IP addresses
 2. IP Address = digital address of a device
 3. Ports = different services on the same device
 4. TCP/UDP = communication rules
 5. Packets = small pieces of the message
 6. Browser = rebuilds the message into a full website

1. DNS (Domain Name System) : 
		It change the name we type in the browsers into an Ip address. For example, If I type 'youtube.com' DNS finds or change the 'youtube.com' as '142.250.195.206' which is youtube's ip address

			What Happens Behind the Scenes:
				1. Browser checks local cache: “Have I visited this site before?”
				2. If not found, it asks the DNS resolver (usually your ISP)
				3. The resolver queries root DNS servers (starting point of DNS)
				4. They direct it to TLD servers (.com, .org, .net)
				5. Then it contacts authoritative DNS servers for google.com
				6. It gets the IP address back
				7. Your browser now connects to that IP address on port 443 (HTTPS)
			
			DNS LOOKUP types :
				1. A Record - Maps domain to IPv4 address
				2. AAAA Record - Maps domain to IPv6 address
				3. CNAME - Alias for another domain
				4. MX Record - Mail server info (used in emails)
				5. NS Record - Name server of the domain
				6. TXT Record - Extra info (like SPF for email security)
			
			DNS in Cyber Security : 
					--Risk--						--Description--
				DNS Spoofing		Attacker gives you a fake IP address for a real domain
				DNS Hijacking		Changes your DNS settings to redirect traffic
				DNS Tunneling		Hides malware or commands inside DNS queries
				DNS Leak			When DNS traffic is not encrypted and can be spied on

2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) :
		An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number given to every device connected to a network, like a computer, phone, or server.
		It’s how devices find and talk to each other on the internet or local network — just like your home address is used to receive letters.

				Real-Life Analogy
				--In Real Life--		--On Internet--
				Your home				Your device
				Street address			IP address
				Postman					Internet routers
				Letter					Data packet

		Types of IP :
			1. IPv4 (32-bit) - Format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, Example: 192.168.1.1
			2. IPv6 (128-bit) - Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
		
		Category of Ip :
			1. Public IP	- Your device’s internet identity (visible to others online), 	Example : 103.44.220.1
			2. Private IP	- Used inside your local network (home, school, etc.), 			Example : 192.168.1.2
			3. Static IP	- Does not change												Used by websites/servers
			4. Dynamic IP	- Changes often (assigned by your ISP/router),					Common for home users

			Common Private IP range :
				1. 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255	- Home networks
				2. 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255		- Large networks
				3. 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255		- Medium-sized networks
			
			IPs in Cybersecurity
				IP scanning	- To find live devices (e.g., with nmap)
				IP blocking	- Firewalls block suspicious IPs
				IP spoofing	- Faking an IP to hide attacker's identity
				Geolocation	- You can track location based on IP
