Network Essentials :
 LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) :
  1. IP (Internet Protocol) : Specific address given to a computer or a device like the roll number of a student.
  2. SUBNET : It defines the range of the LAN which looks like 255.255.0.0 where these 255 tells the constant value and the 0's are the changable values
  3. ROUTER : Allows the device fromt the LAN to communicate to the Outside Networks
 WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK) :
  1. NAT (NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSMISSION) : It hides the local area IP and change it into some other IP's like 192.168.1.10 to 6.23.5.3
  2. FIREWALL : Restricts the communication of the Internet or the outside Network into the local Area Network which is like blocking the access
  3. DMZ (DE MILITARIZED ZONE) : LAN create a DMZ where the external device comes for the communication will be moved to the DMZ for communication where the device will be responsible for everything
  4. PORT FORWARDING : It also uses for the communication of external device directly into the network by selecting a port forwarding where communcation happens in the forwarded port only.
  

CIA Triad :
 1. Confendiatility : Secure for the user
 2. Integrity : no data modification is done without permission	
 3. Availability : data is available for the legal users

How Internet works :
 1. DNS = translates names to IP addresses
 2. IP Address = digital address of a device
 3. Ports = different services on the same device
 4. TCP/UDP = communication rules
 5. Packets = small pieces of the message
 6. Browser = rebuilds the message into a full website

1. DNS (Domain Name System) : 
		It change the name we type in the browsers into an Ip address. For example, If I type 'youtube.com' DNS finds or change the 'youtube.com' as '142.250.195.206' which is youtube's ip address

			What Happens Behind the Scenes:
				1. Browser checks local cache: “Have I visited this site before?”
				2. If not found, it asks the DNS resolver (usually your ISP)
				3. The resolver queries root DNS servers (starting point of DNS)
				4. They direct it to TLD servers (.com, .org, .net)
				5. Then it contacts authoritative DNS servers for google.com
				6. It gets the IP address back
				7. Your browser now connects to that IP address on port 443 (HTTPS)
			
			DNS LOOKUP types :
				1. A Record - Maps domain to IPv4 address
				2. AAAA Record - Maps domain to IPv6 address
				3. CNAME - Alias for another domain
				4. MX Record - Mail server info (used in emails)
				5. NS Record - Name server of the domain
				6. TXT Record - Extra info (like SPF for email security)
			
			DNS in Cyber Security : 
					--Risk--						--Description--
				DNS Spoofing		Attacker gives you a fake IP address for a real domain
				DNS Hijacking		Changes your DNS settings to redirect traffic
				DNS Tunneling		Hides malware or commands inside DNS queries
				DNS Leak			When DNS traffic is not encrypted and can be spied on

2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) :
		An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number given to every device connected to a network, like a computer, phone, or server.
		It’s how devices find and talk to each other on the internet or local network — just like your home address is used to receive letters.

				Real-Life Analogy
				--In Real Life--		--On Internet--
				Your home				Your device
				Street address			IP address
				Postman					Internet routers
				Letter					Data packet

		Types of IP :
			1. IPv4 (32-bit) - Format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, Example: 192.168.1.1
			2. IPv6 (128-bit) - Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
		
		Category of Ip :
			1. Public IP	- Your device’s internet identity (visible to others online), 	Example : 103.44.220.1
			2. Private IP	- Used inside your local network (home, school, etc.), 			Example : 192.168.1.2
			3. Static IP	- Does not change												Used by websites/servers
			4. Dynamic IP	- Changes often (assigned by your ISP/router),					Common for home users

			Common Private IP range :
				1. 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255	- Home networks
				2. 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255		- Large networks
				3. 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255		- Medium-sized networks
			
			IPs in Cybersecurity
				IP scanning	- To find live devices (e.g., with nmap)
				IP blocking	- Firewalls block suspicious IPs
				IP spoofing	- Faking an IP to hide attacker's identity
				Geolocation	- You can track location based on IP
	
	*SUBNET* :
		Subnetting is the process of dividing a big network into smaller, manageable parts called subnets.
	
		Why Do We Subnet?
			Reason				Explanation
			Organization		Makes it easier to manage large networks
			Security			Devices in one subnet can be isolated from others
			Traffic Control		Reduces network congestion
			IP Saving			Helps in better use of available IP addresses
		
		A subnet is a range of IP addresses that belong to a single network.
		IP Address:        192.168.1.10
		Subnet Mask:       255.255.255.0

		| Subnet Mask     | Meaning                      | Hosts Allowed           |
		| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
		| 255.0.0.0       | Very large network (Class A) | Over 16 million         |
		| 255.255.0.0     | Medium network (Class B)     | Over 65,000             |
		| 255.255.255.0   | Small network (Class C)      | 254 usable hosts        |
		| 255.255.255.255 | Only one device              | For testing or loopback |

		CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) :
			IP addresses were grouped in fixed blocks called Class A, B, and C, which wasted a lot of IP addresses. 
			CIDR was introduced to allow more flexible division of IP address space, based on need rather than fixed classes.

			Term				Meaning
			CIDR				Classless Inter-Domain Routing
			Notation			192.168.1.0/24 — the /24 shows how many bits are for the network
			Why it's useful		Saves IP addresses, allows flexible subnetting, improves routing efficiency

		IP Address Components
			Say your IP is: 192.168.1.10
			with Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 or /24

			Part		Value
			Network		192.168.1. (shared by all devices in subnet)
			Host		10 (unique for each device)
			Broadcast	192.168.1.255 (used to send to all in subnet)

		Subnetting in Cybersecurity
				Use					Why It Matters
			Network Scanning	You scan a subnet to find live devices
			Segmentation		Isolate sensitive machines into their own subnet
			Defense				Firewalls can control traffic between subnets
			Monitoring			Easier to watch smaller network zones

3. PORTS :
		A port is like a door or gate through which data enters or leaves a device using the internet or any network.
		Your device can run many services at the same time — like web, email, remote access — and each one uses a different port number to keep them separate.

		Total Ports and Ranges :
			There are 65,536 ports in total — from 0 to 65535.
			They are divided into 3 ranges:
				Range			Name					Used By
				0 – 1023		Well-known ports		HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS, etc.
				1024 – 49151	Registered ports		Apps like Skype, Zoom
				49152 – 65535	Dynamic/Private ports	Temporary, for outbound connections
		
		Common Ports :
				Port		Protocol		Use
				20, 21		FTP				File transfers
				22			SSH				Secure remote login (Linux, servers)
				23			Telnet			Remote login (insecure)
				25			SMTP			Sending email
				53			DNS				Resolving domain names
				80			HTTP			Web (insecure)
				110			POP3			Receiving email
				143			IMAP			Receiving email
				443			HTTPS			Secure web traffic
				3306		MySQL			Database connections
				3389		RDP				Windows Remote Desktop

		How Ports Work in a Connection
			> When you visit a website like https://google.com:
			> Your computer connects to Google’s IP
			> It targets port 443 (used for HTTPS)
			> Google replies using your IP and a random high port (like 55234)
			> This way, both devices know how to talk

		To See Open Ports in the system :
			1. Linux : sudo netstat -tuln (t → TCP, u → UDP, l → Listening, n → Numeric IPs and ports)
			2. Windows : netstat -aon
		
		Ports in Cybersecurity :
				Activity				Purpose
			Port Scanning			Attackers/pentesters scan for open ports using tools like nmap
			Backdoors				Malicious software listens on hidden ports
			Firewalls				Block unwanted ports (e.g., block port 23 to disable Telnet)
			Network Hardening		Close unused ports to reduce attack surface
